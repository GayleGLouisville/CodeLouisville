# CodeLouisville
This is my CodeLouisville project. It is a tongue-in-cheek guide to surviving a zombie apocalypse.

I am an avid horror movie fan so a fun project like this seemed appropriate.

Please note that there is a quiz button in the middle of the index page.  It will take you to a functioning javascript quiz.

There is an element on https://gayleglouisville.github.io/CodeLouisville/rules.html that can only be viewed on medium and large screens.

There are no special requirements to view the site.
